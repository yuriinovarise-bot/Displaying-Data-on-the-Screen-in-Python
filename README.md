Displaying Data on the Screen in Python

In Python, the print() function allows us to display information in the console.
It’s one of the most commonly used functions when learning Python.

Example 1 — Printing a String

To print text, you can use quotes around the text inside the print() function:

print('hello')


This will display:

hello

Example 2 — Printing a Number

You can also print numbers without quotes:

print(1)


This will display:

1
